      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Lake Larson, an Eagle Scout and senior in Aerospace Engineering at The University of Alabama — Roll Tide! I am actively seeking an internship for the summer of 2025. My passions lie in materials science and computer simulations (CFD), and I have hands-on experience in both areas, as highlighted below.</p>
      <p>I’m also an active member of my school's Formula SAE chapter, where I spend most of my free time designing and manufacturing the next year’s car. Please feel free to explore my website, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!</p>

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

      <h3>Flight Test Structures and Dynamics Intern — Lockheed Martin RMS (Sikorsky)</h3>
      <p>Currently an intern at Sikorsky’s flight test facility in Jupiter, FL, where I assist in processing and analyzing flight test data to extract key performance metrics.</p>

      <h3>Thermo-Structural Systems Co-op — Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (May 2024 – May 2025)</h3>
      <p>I design, conduct, monitor, and troubleshoot hundreds of material property tests to meet customers’ data requirements, ensuring precise results that align with high industry standards.</p>
      <p>During my first term, I collaborated on pioneering crack propagation studies by designing specialized test fixtures and developing a data interpreter. This provided engineers with accurate results and tools to improve future testing.</p>
      <p>Across these projects, I drafted technical drawings that accommodated customer test sample specifications within the provided materials, enabling efficient fabrication by our internal machine shop and ensuring on-time project completion.</p>
      <p>In my second term, I supported the standardization and organization of test samples and associated hardware by surveying shop technicians and engineers to ensure optimal specimens were selected. I also played a key role in developing an internal IRAD product that reduced test setup time by 50%, overseeing the entire process — from communicating with technicians and drafting technical drawings to coordinating machining and managing final assembly.</p>

      <h3>Aerodynamics Assistant Lead Engineer — Formula SAE (Crimson Racing) (August 2022 – Present)</h3>
      <p>I currently serve as the Aerodynamics Assistant Lead and Senior Engineer for the Rear Wing of our CR25 car (featured in the Projects section). Previously, I was the Side Aero Senior Engineer for our CR22B car.</p>
      <p>Through my involvement in FSAE, I’ve developed strong communication and collaboration skills. I’ve learned the importance of compromise in achieving design goals and ensuring system integration across subsystems. I have also helped manufacture over 20 carbon fiber parts, overseeing the process from mold design to final production.</p>
      <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my role is mentoring and supporting the next generation of engineers.</p>

      <h3>Residential Advisor — University of Alabama Housing & Residential Communities (August 2023 – December 2024)</h3>
      <p>I serve as a Residential Advisor to 40 freshmen this year, and I served 40 residents the previous year. I have planned and led 9 community-building events, including an ice cream social, a dodgeball tournament, and game nights. I work closely with residents to help build a supportive community that allows them to adjust to college life in a healthy, positive way.</p>

      <h3>Photographer — The University of Alabama Recreation Marketing Department (August 2023 – December 2024)</h3>
      <p>I photograph events and promotional material for the university’s recreation department, contributing to marketing campaigns through high-quality visual content.</p>

      <h2>Key Projects</h2>

      <h3>CR25 Rear Wing Design</h3>
      <p>Increased the efficiency of the rear wing by 11% and reduced its weight by nearly 1.5 lbs. This was achieved through iterative design using CFD and SolidWorks to reduce pressure gradients and minimize vortices off the endplate. The result was lower induced drag and increased aerodynamic efficiency.</p>

      <h3>CR22 Side Aero Design</h3>
      <p>Created the first iterations of side aero for Crimson Racing. This introduced me to CFD and SolidWorks, and taught me how to use them in iterative design. The work laid the foundation for future side aero development.</p>

      <h3>Glider Project</h3>
      <p>In my freshman year, I designed and built a model glider as part of my Intro to Engineering class. The glider successfully carried 24 quarters a distance of 40.3 feet.</p>
      <p>This project marked my first experience with a real engineering challenge — and when I knew I wanted to become an engineer.</p>
      <p>The wing construction was a highlight: I imported an airfoil from Airfoil Tools into SolidWorks, added a spar slot, 3D printed the ribs, mounted them to a balsa wood spar, and used a lightweight paper skin for covering.</p>

      <h3>Python Dive Calculator</h3>
      <p>For my final project in an Intro to Python course, I built a scuba dive calculator. The program takes various inputs such as tank pressure and desired depth, and calculates how long you can explore safely while ensuring adequate air for surfacing.</p>

      <h3>Flag Deposit Box (Eagle Scout Project)</h3>
      <p>I planned, acquired donated materials, and led my troop in building a flag deposit box. I managed task delegation and secured approval from the church committee for its placement.</p>
      <p>The box is still in use today and averages 30 deposited flags per month, all of which are properly retired.</p>
